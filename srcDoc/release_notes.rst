Release Notes
=============

Compatibility Master
--------------------

Using Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Governance and Permission files have been updated to be compatible with
the latest release for *RTI Connext DDS*, and are compatible with *RTI
Connext DDS* 5.2.7 and greater.

If you are compiling *RTI Perftest* against 5.2.5, you will need to get
the certificates from the ``release/2.0`` branch. You can do that by
using the following git command from the top-level directory of your
repository:

::

    git checkout release/2.0 -- resource/secure

Compilation Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*RTI Perftest* is designed to compile and work against the *RTI Connext
DDS* 5.2.x, 5.3.x and 6.0.0 releases.

Certain features, however, are not compatible with all the *RTI Connext
DDS* versions, since the build scripts make use of certain specific
parameters in *rtiddsgen* that might change or not be present between
releases:

-  The ``--secure`` and ``--openssl-home`` parameters will not work for
   versions prior to *RTI Connext DDS* 5.2.5.

-  Java code generation against *RTI Connext DDS 5.2.0.x* will fail
   out-of-the-box. You can disable this by adding the ``--skip-java-build``
   flag. See the Known Issues section for more information and
   alternatives.

-  C# code generation against *RTI Connext DDS 5.2.0.x* is not
   supported. You can disable this by adding the ``--skip-cs-build``
   flag.

Release Notes Master
--------------------

What's New in Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New tutorial section in the documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new tutorial section has been added to the documentation.

The main purpose of that section is to hold examples of how to properly use
*RTI Perftest* in real life scenarios to gather the limits for throughput
and latency. It will also help showing what is the impact of using *RTI
Connext DDS* features.

New command line option to send data loaded from a file (#210)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting in this release, a new command line option has been added to the
*Traditional C++* API implementation that allows the customer loading a file
into memory and send the data of the file instead using an empty buffer as the
payload for the *RTI Perftest* messages.

New command line option to show the *DataWriter* and *DataReader* queue stats (#251)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By using the `-cacheStats` command line parameter *RTI Perftest* now displays the
*Send Queue* `sample_count` and `sample_count_peak` in the publisher side. For the
subscriber side, *RTI Perftest* displays the *Receive Queue* `sample_count` and
`sample_count_peak`.

Compilation option to measure latency time in nano-seconds (#253)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* can now be compiled using the POSIX calls to measure latency
in *nanoseconds*, instead of using the *RTI Connext DDS Professional* calls
which return the time in *microseconds*.

This option can be enabled at compilation time by using the `--ns-resolution`.
It is only implemented for Linux/MacOS/QNX Systems.

Switching value for Bounded to Unbounded-Sequences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, the value to switch between Bounded and Unbounded-Sequences was set
to 63000 Bytes (63000 items in the sequence). This value was defined that way to
be close to the `message_size_max` value for the `UDPv4` transport and make the
switch for Synchronous to Asynchronous Publishing coincide with the switch
between Bounded and Unbounded-Sequences.

These 2 changes in behavior have been decoupled. The new maximum value for a
Bounded-Sequence is 1MB (1048576 items in the sequence).

Behavior for `SHMEM` and Asynchronous publishing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value to switch to Asynchronous Publishing is no longer a fixed value, but
it is calculated given then minimum `message_size_max` accross all the enabled
transports.

In the case of using `SHMEM`, the value of `message_size_max` is not set, but
instead is calculated to fit samples of the size specified by the user via the
`-datalen` command-line parameter.

Find more information about this in the **Large Samples (Use-Cases)** section of
the documentation.

Add Security Governance files for Sign And Encrypt with original auth for RTPS (#253)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added 2 new Governance profiles to the list of generated governance files in
`resource/secure/input/governances/`:

- `PerftestGovernance_RTPSEncryptWithOrigAuth.xml`
- `PerftestGovernance_RTPSSignWithOrigAuth.xml`

As well as their respective signed versions (`signed_`...).

New output formats available to display data (#280)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* default output format has been improved. This format should now
be compatible with the `CSV` format standard, therefore allowing the copy into
spreadsheet editors or easier parsing via scripting. This change has been
introduced in a way in which the output retains its readability, by correctly
aligning rows and columns and by printing headers for each column.

With this change we also introduced the option of changing or customizing the
output format by using the `-outputFormat <format>`. At this point the supported
values are `csv` (default), `json` or `legacy` (Referring to the previous
output used by *RTI Perftest*.

For *C++ Traditional* and *C++ Modern* there is one more type support, `dds`. It send
all test data using dds instead of show in terminal.

Another flag has been added, `-noOutputHeaders`, in order to skip printing the
headers rows (for the summaries and also for the interval information).

Added support for -threadPriorities command line parameter in QNX platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of -threadPriorities command is now supported on QNX platforms.
You can either specify three numeric values representing the priority of each
of the threads or, instead, three characters representing the priorities: h,n,l.

Overhead from *RTI Perftest*'s type is now programmatically calculated. (#265)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The overhead size resulting from the serialized sample of the Perftest type is
now calculated programmatically. This makes accurate the exact number of bytes
that are sent when CustomTypes or FlatData types are used.

Added warning messages when no packets have been received at the end of the test (#303)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When performing certain tests, especially with very few samples, or with very large
ones, the probability of not receiving any samples in Publisher or Subscriber sides
are higher. Starting in this release we will notify the user when the application receives the
message that the test has ended, as well as some suggestions on how to fix this.

New parameter to control showing the serialization/deserialization times (#304)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the feature to show the serialization/deserialization times was added, it was set
to show the data at the end of the test, in the publisher side, as a new line after the
latency results.

This was not convenient, since it can conflict when parsing the latency lines. This has
been resolved adding a new parameter "-showSerializationTime", which enables calculating
and showing the serialization/deserialization times.

New parameter to control the size of the initial Burst (#310)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new command-line parameter (`-initialBurstSize`) has been added to the
*Traditional and Modern C++ API Implementations* in to control the number of
samples sent in the initial burst of samples *RTI Perftest* uses to initialize
the buffers in the sending and receiving paths.

In most of the cases this number should not cause any trouble (as long as it is
big enough), but in certain cases a low number is required due to OS restrictions.

What's Fixed in Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improve message when NDDSHOME/RTIMEHOME paths are not reachable (#222)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* has improved the error message when the path provided to the
`NDDSHOME` or `RTIMEHOME` are incorrect. In previous releases this could be
misleading since it would claim that the path was not provided.

Wrong version in dockerfile for perftest 3.0.1 (#227)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest*'s Dockerfile was outdated. It has now been updated to use the
latest release.

Participant properties always propagate in C++03 (#228)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

QoS properties for Data Readers and Data Writers were being propagated on C++03
implementation.

This behaviour is not needed so has been removed to behave as on Traditional C++.

Wrong capitalization for command line option `--customTypeFlatData` (#232)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed issue in the `build.sh` and `build.bat` where the command line parameter
used to specify that a custom type for Flat Data was provided was wrongly
spelled.

Error finalizing the application when using `SHMEM` for *RTI Connext DDS Micro* (#234)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using *RTI Connext DDS Micro* and setting the transport to `SHMEM` an error
would appear at the end of the test in both publisher and subscriber by the time
he `finalize_instance()` function is called. This errors has been resolved.

The version of *rtiddsgen* is now properly compared to identify the support of certain features (#237)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, the *rtiddsgen* version number was not correctly obtained
by the *RTI Perftest* compilation scripts. This would cause the inclusion of the
wrong compilation flags in certain cases.

Fix incorrect incorrect governance file values for Security (#239)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `PerftestGovernance_RTPSEncryptWithOrigAuthEncryptData.xml` and
`PerftestGovernance_RTPSSignWithOrigAuthEncryptData.xml` governance files were not
correctly writen and they would not set the right flags to encrypt the data.

This issue has been fixed.

Content-Filtered Topics (`-cft`) range option not working properly (#240)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `-cft` option for the *Perftest subscriber* side was not working correctly
when specifying a range of values to filter (e.g. `-cft 3:5`). This behavior has
been corrected.

Fix issue displaying the *RTI Connext DDS Micro* release number (#243)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed issue where *RTI Perftest* would display the `RTIME_DDS_VERSION_REVISION`
instead of the `RTIME_DDS_VERSION_RELEASE` when compiling against *RTI
Connext DDS Micro*.

Fix incorrect number of `max_instances` in the *DataReader* when using *Micro* (#244)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value to `max_instances` assigned to the resouce limits in the *DataReader*
side in *RTI Perftest* when compiling against *RTI Connext DDS Micro* was not
set correctly, and it would not account for the extra sample used to skip the
*CFTs*.

Summary displays *Asynchronous publishing* active when using *Zero-Copy* and *Large Data* (#246)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed issue where *RTI Perftest* would present in the summary of the *Publisher*
side the *Asynchronous Publishing* set to *true* regardless on if the test was
using *Zero-Copy* or not.

When using *Zero-Copy*, the size of the message being sent will always be
constant, independent on the size of the sample being sent, as it is just a
reference to where the sample is stored in memory.
This means that *Asynchronous Publishing* is not needed in any case.

Fix documentation examples for *FlatData* and *Zero-Copy* (#249)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the documentation examples for *FlatData* and *Zero-Copy* the data sizes used
for publisher and subscriber were not matching. Also, in the *Best Effort* case,
the command lines were not including the `-bestEffort` option.

Make discovery process more robust (#261)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, *RTI Perftest* was not checking that all the entities of
the three topics (AnnouncementTopic, ThroughputTopic and LatencyTopic) were
discovering each other, only the ones for the Throughput topic. This could lead
to some corner cases where the performance test would not work correctly. This
behavior has been corrected.

Workaround for MICRO-2191 (#261)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The combination of the previous issue and a bug in *RTI Connext DDS Micro*
(MICRO-2191), would cause that the LatencyTopic endpoints were not correctly
discovered in certain cases, making impossible to gather Latency Numbers.

Update the idl to use prefix annotations (#270)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, *RTI Perftest* idls used a combination of the new
prefix annotations and the old ones. This inconsistency has been fixed.

This imposes a restriction (already existing) in the minimum version for which
*RTI Perftest* can be compiled to *RTI Connext DDS Professional* 5.3.1.

`DTLS` transport does not work in Traditional/Modern C++ by default (#281)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default *RTI Perftest* subscriber would fail when the transport was set to
`DTLS` due to an incorrect private key in the subscriber side. This issue has been
resolved.

Fixed port calculation in RawTransport with multiples subscribers (#283)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RawTransport port calculation has been fixed when we have multiples subscribers.

Fixed segmentation fault when finishing tests in Traditional/Modern C++ (#288)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of `-useReadThread` (which internally would imply using `waitsets`)
caused a segmentation fault at the end of the test (when *RTI Perftest* deleted
the entities). This would affect Traditional and Modern C++ Implementations.
This issue has been fixed.

`-sleep` option not working correctly with values larger than 1 second (#299)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The calculation of the seconds and nanoseconds to sleep between sending samples
when using the `-sleep` command line option was not correct for both the Traditional
and the Modern C++ implementations. This issue has been resolved.

Error in Modern C++ when using FlatData (#306)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An error was found when testing *FlatData* in the *Modern C++ API* Implementation
where the `write()` call would fail to find the right instance handle. This issue
would show up in any of the 3 topics and would cause an exception.

`-sendQueueSize` not correctly applied to the subscriber side (#309)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even though the use of `-sendQueueSize` was modified to be allowed in the
Subscriber side for the *Pong Datawriter*, the values for the maximum and
minimum send Queue size where not correctly set in code. This issue has been
fixed.

Error using Zero-Copy and checking sample consistency with waitsets (#316 and #317)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed issue in the *Traditional and Modern* C++ API implemetation, where, when
using `-zeroCopy` + `-useReadThread` + `-checkConsistency` the middleware would
show:

    DDS_SampleInfoSeq_get_reference:!assert index out of bounds
    TestDataLarge_ZeroCopy_w_FlatData_tSeq_get_reference:!assert index out of bounds
    DDS_DataReader_is_metp_data_consistent:ERROR: Bad parameter: sample

In the case of the *Modern* C++ API implementation this would also cause a
crash. This issue has been fixed.

Code generation failure on Windows when `FlatData` is disabled (#319)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows, a failure will occur when trying to compile an architecture without
support for `FlatData`. This may occur if the `RTI Connext DDS Professional`
version is prior to the inclusion of the feature or if we intentionally disable
it in the `build.bat` code. It might also happen for certain embeded windows
architectures.

This issue has been resolved.

The `RTI_LANGUAGE_CPP_MODERN` flag is not correctly when using the build.sh script (#322)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An issue has been resolved in the `build.sh` script that would cause the
`RTI_LANGUAGE_CPP_MODERN` define flag not to be propagated correctly when compiling.
This issue was not causing a bug or a wrong behavior in previous versions of
*RTI Perftest*.

`-batchSize` parameter not correctly written in the Traditional and Modern C++ API implementations (#324)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue for the Traditional and Modern C++ API implementations where the
parameter manager would expect `-batchsize` instead of `-batchSize`. This issue
was only a problem for *VxWorks* systems, where the parsing of the parameters is
case sensitive.

Fixed performance degradation in Modern C++ when using Dynamic Data (#332)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using Dynamic Data, the `Send()` path would always try to clear the content
of the sample prior to start repopulating it. This should only be necesary if the
sequence size changes. This issue has been fixed.

Release Notes 3.0
-----------------

What's New in 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ability to use your own type in RTI Perftest (#33)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now supports the ability to use your own custom type.
It is possible to measure the performance of your own type.

The Custom Types feature allows you to use your own customized types instead of
the one provided by *RTI Perftest*. It is designed in such a way that the number
of changes in the code and configuration files is minimal.

RTI Perftest thread priorities can be configured via command-line parameter (#65)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the Traditional and Modern C++ API Implementations, a new parameter,
`-threadPriorities`, has been added to *RTI Perftest*. This parameter allows you
to set the priorities on the different threads created by *RTI Connext DDS*
and by the application itself.

This parameter accepts either three numeric values (whichever numeric values you choose)
representing the priority of each of the threads or, instead, three characters representing
the priorities. These characters are h (high), n (normal) and l (low). These parameters
can be used as follows:

::

-threadPriorities X:Y:Z

Where:

- **X** is for the priority of the Main Thread that manages all the communication.
  X is also used for the Asynchronous Thread when using large data.
- **Y** is the priority for all the receive threads. This value will be used for
  the Receive Thread created by *RTI Connext DDS*. If ``-useReadThread`` (use waitsets)
  is used, Y is for the thread in charge of receiving the data.
- **Z** is the priority for the Event and DataBase Threads created at the
  *RTI Connext DDS* level.

This feature will only work for *RTI Connext DDS Professional*.
To see what values should be used for the different threads see
the following information in the *RTI Connext DDS Core Libraries Platform Notes*:

- The "Thread-Priority Definitions for Linux Platforms" table
- The "Thread-Priority Definitions for OS X Platforms" table
- The "Thread-Priority Definitions for Windows Platforms" table

Raw Transport Support (#77)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now supports raw transport communications. This allows the
application to conduct performance tests skipping the DDS protocol. The purpose of this
feature is to allow the calculation of protocol overhead and time differences.

To run a test with this feature, the ``-rawTransport`` command line option is
required.

The Raw Transport feature is only aviable for C++ and supports two kinds of transport
protocols, UDPv4 and Shared Memory.

The Raw Transport feature allows the following configurations:

-  `Multicast` (only for UDPv4)
-  `One-to-many communication` (Pub -> Sub)
-  `Latency Test` / `Throughput Test`
-  `Scan`

Some of the command-line parameters that exist for DDS are not supported if
``-rawTransport`` is used.

For the command ``-peer``, the behavior has been modified. You can use ``-peer`` to set a
peer address and a new optional ID:

    Syntax: -peer <x.x.x.x>|<x.x.x.x:id>

    If no ID is provided, it's set as zero.

    You can set multiple peers; the maximum value of accepted peers is RTIPERFTEST_MAX_PEERS, 
    which corresponds to 1024.

    Example:

::

    perftest_cpp -pub -rawTransport -peer 127.0.0.1:5 -peer 127.0.0.1:6


A new command-line parameter, `-noBlockingSockets`, has been added:

-  This parameter changes the blocking behavior of send sockets to `never block`.
-  It is only available when ``-rawTransport`` is set with UDPv4 as the protocol.
-  This parameter can reduce the lost packets.
-  CHANGING THIS PARAMETER FROM THE DEFAULT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE VARIATIONS.

Support for RTI Connext DDS Micro 3.0.0 (#78)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, *RTI Perftest* will have support for *RTI Connext
DDS Micro* 3.0.0 and above.

By using the ``--micro`` and the ``--RTIMEHOME path`` command-line options at
compile time, *RTI Perftest* will generate code for *RTI Connext DDS Micro* and
try to compile using ``cmake`` (the path for which can also be configured by
a command-line parameter in the build script). In this case, the 
*RTI Perftest* executable will be placed similarly to *RTI Connext DDS Professional's* 
executable; however, it will be named ``perftest_cpp_micro``.

Most *RTI Perftest* features are available when using *RTI Connext Micro*; however, some
command-line parameters and options are available only for *RTI Connext DDS
Professional*. More information about the supported parameters can be found in the
*Command-Line Parameters* examples section.

Build HTML and PDF documentation (#94)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest*'s build script for Linux now offers the option to generate the HTML
and PDF documentation from the .rst files in srcDoc.

Allow 3 differents addresses for -multicastAddr feature (#97)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions of *RTI Perftest*, the `-multicastAddr` command-line
parameter only supported a single address as input. This behavior has been
improved. In addition to providing only one address, this parameter also
allows you to provide three different addresses for each of the three topics used by
*RTI Perftest* (Throughput, Latency, and Announcement).

Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported and can be set together on the same
input command. All the input addresses must be in multicast range.

If you specify only one address, *RTI Perftest* will use that one 
and the two consecutive ones: for example, if you give 1.1.1.1, *RTI Perftest* will use 
1.1.1.1 + 1.1.1.2 + 1.1.1.3. The higher values supported are `239.255.255.253` for IPv4
and `FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFC` for IPv6.

Display in RTI Perftest's subscriber side if the type expected is large data (#123)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* requires you to specify on the subscriber side the Data Length parameter
if the data to be received is larger than the `MAX_SYNCHRONOUS_SIZE` constant. This
parameter is used to change from the regular `TestData_t` type to `TestDataLarge_t` (used for
large data). However, this was not displayed anywhere in the summary shown by
the subscriber.

This issue has been fixed. Now the subscriber will show a short message stating
that it is expecting the large data type.

Added --compiler and --linker command-line parameters to build.sh (#152)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When building using makefiles, you can now use the `--compiler` and/or `--linker`
command-line parameters to explicitly specify to the `build.sh` script the
compiler/linker executables that will be used by *rtiddsgen*.

Ease the execution of *RTI Perftest* in *VxWorks* (#167)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, it was not clear how to run `RTI Perftest` in `VxWorks`:
each command-line parameter had to be appended to the `argv` array inside
`publisher_main` and `subscriber_main` in `perftest_publisher.cxx`. This
required recompiling each time the parameters changed.

This behavior has been simplified: in order to run in `VxWorks`, you can 
call the `perftest_cpp_main` function and receive a simple string
containing all the command-line parameters.

Support *RTI Perftest* on *Android* platforms (#186)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although the code for *RTI Perftest* is supposed to be platform-independent, it
might not work out-of-the-box for mobile operating systems, since it expects to be used in a
terminal.

Starting in version 3.0.0, *RTI Perftest* can also be compiled and used for
Android platforms, using the basic graphical interface generated by *rtiddsgen*
to print the output of the application.

Support *RTI Connext DDS 6.0.0* *FlatData* and *Zero-Copy* features (#211)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Connext DDS 6.0.0* introduces *RTI FlatData* language binding and
*Zero-Copy* transfer mode over Shared Memory.

*RTI FlatData* reduces the number of copies made when sending a sample
from a DataWriter to a DataReader from four to just two by building samples
where the in-memory representation matches the wire representation.

*Zero-Copy* transfer mode accomplishes zero copies by using the shared memory
(SHMEM) built-in transport to send 16-byte references to samples within a
SHMEM segment owned by the DataWriter. This does not only reduces the latency
but also makes the latency independent of the sample size.

Starting in version 3.0.0, *RTI Perftest* supports *RTI FlatData* language
binding and Zero Copy transfer over Shared Memory.

This feature is not available when compiling for *RTI Connext DDS Micro*.

Increase `send_socket_buffer_size` for the `UDPv4` transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to achieve better performance with dealing with Large Data, the
`send_socket_buffer_size` property has been modified from 500KB to 1MB in the
*QoS* file.

What's Fixed in 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove duplicate code on RTIDDSImpl when the topic name is checked (#99)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each time a DataReader or DataWriter was created, the topic name was compared with all the
default topic names (Throughput, Latency, Announcement), in order to get
the proper QoS Profile Name. This led to a lot of duplicated code on the
`createWriter` and `createReader` functions.

This behavior has been fixed by creating a new function `getQoSProfileName`
that accesses a new map, `_qoSProfileNameMap`, which contains the three topic
names and their corresponding profile names.

Fix incorrect parsing of the `-executionTime` command-line parameter (#102)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, for the Traditional and Modern C++ API implementations,
the `-executionTime <sec>` command-line parameter would ignore any invalid
value for the `<sec>` parameter without any notification to the user.

This behavior has been fixed and unified for all the API implementations,
which now show an error when finding a wrong value for the `<sec>` option.

Ensure compatibility for the Traditional and Modern C++ Implementation (#114)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the changes added for #55 broke compatibility when compiling certain
platforms with no support for C++11. This issue has been fixed.

Wait for all perftest executions to finish before finalizing participants factory (#120)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In *VxWorks* kernel mode, static objects are shared across different runs of the same
*RTI Perftest* libraries/executables, and changes in one run would cause changes in the other.
When finalizing the *Participant Factory* after deleting the participant of an *RTI Perftest* execution,
an error about outstanding participants in the domain was printed. This error occurred
because the *Participant Factory* was shared accross runs in the same machine;
therefore, participants from other executions prevented the factory from
being properly finalized.

This issue has been fixed by checking that the factory is empty of participants
before finalizing it.

Fix incorrect behavior for the `-unbounded` command-line option when not using large data (#125)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the 2.4 release, a regression was introduced: the use of `-unbounded`
caused a failure when using datasizes from 28 to 63000 bytes. This
issue has been resolved.

Update maximum sample size accepted by *RTI Perftest* (#136)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum size of a sample accepted by *RTI Perftest* has been updated to
be compatible with *RTI Connext DDS 6.0.0*. This new value is 2147482620 bytes.

Add option to enable latency measurements in machines with low resolution clocks (#162)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the machine where *RTI Perftest* is being executed has a low resolution
clock, the regular logic might not report accurate latency numbers. Therefore,
the application now implements a simple solution to get a rough estimate of the
latency.

Before sending the first sample, *RTI Perftest* records the time; right after
receiving the last pong, the time is recorded again. Under the assumption that
the processing time is negligible, the average latency is calculated as half
the time taken divided by the number of samples sent.

This calculation only makes sense if latencyCount = 1 (Latency Test), since
it assumes that every single ping is answered.

Stop using alarm function to schedule functions since it is deprecated (#164)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using `-executionTime <seconds>` parameter, internally, *RTI Perftest* was scheduling a
function call by using it as a handler when an ALARM signal was received.
This ALARM signal was set to be signaled in the amount of seconds specified by the *executionTime*
parameter using the `alarm()` function available in POSIX systems; however,
this alarm function has been deprecated or is even missing in some of RTI's supported platforms.

This issue has been fixed by using a thread that sleeps for the amount of
seconds specified, after which the thread calls the desired function.

Remove the use of certain static variables that caused issues in *VxWorks* kernel mode (#166)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running two or more instances of *RTI Perftest* within the same machine in *VxWorks* kernel mode,
some parameters were shared between instances. This sharing happened because static variables are shared
across different runs of the same *RTI Perftest* libraries/executables, and changes in one run would cause
changes in the other. This issue has ben fixed.

Use Connext DDS implementation for the `milliSleep` method in C++ (#180)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``PerftestClock::milliSleep()`` method has been modified in the Traditional and Modern C++ implementations
to always use the *RTI Connext DDS* sleep functionality.
This change makes the sleep functionality independent of the operating system.

At the same time, the code has been improved to avoid overflowing the time of the sleeping
period.

Fix Bottleneck due to low SHMEM QoS resources settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The QoS setting `dds.transport.shmem.builtin.received_message_count_max`
was set based on the OS default receive buffer size for SHMEM and the
size of the payload sent on a sample.

The resulting allocated space was too small and therefore the throughput
was being limited.

The `dds.transport.shmem.builtin.received_message_count_max` and
`dds.transport.shmem.builtin.receive_buffer_size` QoS settings have been
increased to avoid this bottleneck.

Fix Custom Types failure due to the use of Flat Data (#221)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FlatData support for Custom Types was not complete thus errors arise when using
``--customType`` build option.

Now this issue has been fixed and FlatData custom types can be used along with
regular custom types by using the new ``--customTypeFlatData`` build option.

The only known limitation is that these FlatData types must be declared as mutable.

Release Notes 2.4
-----------------

What's New in 2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary of test parameters printed before RTI Perftest runs (#46)(#67)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* provides a great number of command-line parameters, plus the option
of using the *xml configuration* file for modifying the RTI Connext DDS QoS. This
could lead to some confusion with regards to the test that will run when executing
the application.

In order to make this clear, *RTI Perftest* now shows a summary at the beginning of
the test with most of the relevant parameters being used for thetest. The
summary is done for both Publisher and Subscriber sides.

Added command-line parameters to simplify single API build (#50)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest Build scripts* now support building a single API using the
following command-line parameters:

    --java-build
    --cpp03-build
    --cpp-build
    --cs-build

Added RTI Perftest and RTI Connext DDS information at beginning of test (#54)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now prints at the beginning of the test
its version and the version of *RTI Connext DDS* against which *RTI Perftest* is
compiled.

Automatically regenerate `qos_string.h` file if `perftest_qos_profiles.xml` is modified (#63)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now udpates the `qos_string.h` file with the content of
`perftest_qos_profiles.xml` every time *RTI Perftest* is built for C++
and C++ New PSM.

Enable batching for Throughput-Test mode with 8kB value (#76)(#67)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the enhanced out-of-the-box experience for *RTI Perftest*,
batching is now enabled by default for throughput tests where the datalen is
equal or smaller to 4kB. In such case, the *Batch size* value will be set to 8kB.

Batching will be disabled automatically if *LatencyTest* mode is set or if the
`-batchSize` is lower than two times the `-dataLen`.

Use `UDPv4` and `Shared Memory` as default transport configuration (#80)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, the *RTI Perftest* default was to use only the `UDPv4` transport.
This did not, however, always lead to the best results when testing between
applications within the same machine; it also differed from *RTI Connext DDS*
default behavior, which enables the use of both `UDPv4` and Shared Memory (`SHMEM`).
Now, *RTI Perftest*'s new default behavior is the same as *RTI Connext DDS*: It
enables the use of both `UDPv4` and `SHMEM`.

This change improves the out-of-the-box user experience, getting better numbers
when using the default configuration.

Show percentage of packets lost in subscriber side output (#81)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now displays the percentage of lost packets in addition to the total
number of packets lost. This percentage is displayed once per second with the rest of
the statistics in the *Subscriber* side, as well as at the end of the test.

What's Fixed in 2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improved Dynamic Data Send() and Receive() operations (#55)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Dynamic Data Send() and Received() functions have been optimized
reducing the time spent setting and getting the samples.

As a result of these optimizations *RTI Perftest* now minimizes the time
employed in application-related tasks, therefore maximizing the time spent
sending and receiving calls. This allows a fair comparison between
Dynamic Data results and Generated Type-Code Data results.

Corrected Latency maximum calculation in certain scenarios with low resolution clocks (#58)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, if the clock provided by the system had low resolution, many of the
*Latency* times calculated by sending and receiving back samples would end up being `0us`.
*RTI Perftest* would assume in those cases that this value was an initialization value and it
would reset the maximum latency.

This problem has been fixed. *RTI Perftest* now correctly supports the case where the
latency reported is `0us` by not using it as a control/reset value.

Improved behavior when using the `-scan` command-line option and Best Effort (#59)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, the use of `-scan` in combination with *Best Effort* would result
in sending too many times certain packets used to signal the change of sizes and the
initialization and finalization of the test.

In certain scenarios -- mostly local tests where *RTI Perftest* Publishers and Subscribers
were in the same machine and that machine had limitations with respect to the CPU -- this
problem would cause the *Scan* test to not work properly, since the *Publisher* would make
use of the CPU and network intensively, potentially starving the *Subscriber* side and
making the test hang.

This problem has been fixed.

Reduced memory consumption on Subscriber side (#74)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *initial_samples* value for the *ThroughputQoS* QoS profile has been updated
to a lower number. This profile is used by the *Subscriber* side to create a
*DDS DataWriter*.

This value has been updated in order to decrease memory consumption on
the *RTI Perftest* *Subscriber* side.

In order to ensure that this change does not affect the overall performance of
the application, the initial burst of samples sent by the *Publisher* side has been
also reviewed.  The *Publisher* side now always send a burst big enough to ensure
that the allocations in both *Publisher* and *Subscriber* sides are done before
the test starts.

Fixed compilation in Certain VxWorks platforms (#93)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the *Traditional* and *Modern* C++ implementations were tried to
include `sys/time.h`, but this file might not exist in certain operating systems including
certain VxWorks platforms.

This issue has been fixed, since this library is not needed in the *VxWorks* platforms,
*RTI Perftest* excludes `sys/time.h` when compiling for *VxWorks*.

Migrate RTI Routing Service XML configuration to 6.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RTI Routing Service configuration file has been updated and
it is now supported in the version 6.0.0.

Issues compiling in certain Platforms due to static variable `transportConfigMap` (#161)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In certain architectures the use of the static variable: `static std::map<std::string, TransportConfig> transportConfigMap`
would cause some issues when referencing it from a static context.

In order to avoid this issue, the variable is not static anymore
and it will be initialized in the constructor of the `PerftestTransport` class.

This issue affected both the Traditional and Modern C++ implementations.

Release Notes 2.3.2
-------------------

What's Fixed in 2.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional C++ Semaphore Take() and Give() operations not checking for errors properly (#47)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, the semaphore Take() and Give() operations
were not being checked for errors correctly in the Traditional C++ API implementation.
This has been fixed.

Release Notes 2.3.1
--------------------

What's Fixed in 2.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Keep Duration` not configurable when using `-noPositiveAcks` (#39)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, if the `-noPositiveAcks` command line parameter was provided
the *Disable Positive Acks Keep Duration* QoS setting would be ignored both when
provided via XML configuration or via command line parameter (deprecated option),
instead, *RTI Perftest* would always use the default value set up via code.

This behavior has been fixed. We also took the oportunity to simplify and clarify
the XML configurations when disabling positive Acks.

Show message in sumary when -multicast is present but it wont be used (#44)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, if the `-multicast` command-line parameter was provided but
the transport didn't allow the use of multicast, it would fail silently and no
indication would be shown by RTI Perftest.

Starting from this release, the use of multicast will be shown in the transport
summary at the beginning of the test, and a message will be printed stating if
multicast could not be applied for the transport.

The `-multicast` parameter has been divided into 2: `-multicast` which enables
multicast for a given transport using a set of default multicast addresses and
`-multicastAddr <address>` which enables multicast and sets the multicast IPs to
be the one provided.

Update Security Certificates and Governance files (#49)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Security Certificates and Governance files used when enabling security options
in RTI Perftest have been regenerated and signed again, since they had expired.

The script used for updating the files has been improved to generate certificates
valid for a longer period of time (from one year to ten years).

Segmentation fault when using multiple publishers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions, in scenarios with multiple publishers, every *RTI Perftest*
publisher application with `-pidMultiPubTest` different than 0 would crash in the
process of printing the latency statistics. This behavior has been fixed.

Release Notes 2.3
-----------------

What's New in 2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added Support for DTLS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now supports the use of the *DTLS* plugin. The out of the
box configuration allows the application to work using *DTLS* by just specifying
``-transport DTLS``, however we also included command-line parameters to specify:

- The Certificates and the public/private keys.
- The verbosity.

See the *Test Parameters* section for more information about how to configure DTLS.

Added Support for TLS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now supports the use of *TLS* on top of the *TCP* plugin.
The out-of-the-box configuration allows the application to work using *TLS*
by just specifying ``-transport TLS``, however we also included command-line
parameters to specify:

- The Certificates and the public/private keys.
- The verbosity.
- The Server Bind Port.
- The use of WAN mode.
- The use of a Public Address.

See the *Test Parameters* section for more information about how to configure TLS.

Enhanced TCP Functionalities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the changes for adding support for *TLS*, more functionalities have
been included for *TCP*, including options to specify:

- The verbosity.
- The Server Bind Port.
- The use of WAN mode.
- The use of a Public Address.

See the *Test Parameters* section for more information about how to configure TCP.

Added Support for WAN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* now supports the use of the *WAN* transport plugin.
In order to use this transport the command-line option ``-transport WAN`` needs
to be specified, we also included command-line parameters to specify:

- The WAN Server Address and Port
- The WAN ID.
- The Certificates and the public/private keys in case of using Secure WAN.
- The verbosity.
- The Server Bind Port.

See the *Test Parameters* section for more information about how to configure WAN.

Default Values for ``Reliability`` and ``Transport`` can be Modified via XML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, the Reliability and Transport settings are not set
via code for the different languages, but are set in the XML profile.
This allows you to easily modify these settings without needing to recompile.

These settings can still be modified via command-line parameters.

Added Command-Line Parameter ``-qosLibrary``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, the QoS Library can be selected using the new
``-qosLibrary`` option.

This command-line option, combined with ``-qosFile``, allows you to use custom
QoS profiles that inherit from the default one (``perftest_qos_profiles.xml``).

A simple example is provided here:
``resource/profile_examples/custom_perftest_qos_profiles.xml``.

Changed Name for Command-Line Option from ``-qosProfile`` to ``-qosFile``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, the ``-qosProfile`` command-line parameter has been
changed to ``-qosFile`` to better reflect its use.

Improved ``-scan`` Command-line Parameter Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the previous release, using ``-scan`` caused *RTI Perftest* to execute with
a predefined set of values for -dataLen, and with execution durations related to
the number of latency pings. This behavior has been changed. Now ``-scan`` allows
you to specify a set of -datalen sizes to be used (or you can use the default set).
In addition, the value specified for the '-executionTime' parameter is now used
for each execution during the scan, regardless of the number of latency pings.

When using ``-batchSize`` at the same time as ``-scan`` and not using large
data, the same batch size will be applied to all the data sizes being used by
``-scan``.

Deprecated Some Command-Line Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To simplify the number of parameters *RTI Perftest* accepts, we reviewed and
deprecated some parameters. These parameters will still work for this
release, but they will be deleted or altered for future ones.

-  Deprecated ``-instanceHashBuckets <n>``

The associated value will be the same as the number of instances.

-  Deprecated ``-keepDurationUsec <usec>``

The value will be set in the QoS in the case of using -noPositiveAcks.

-  Combined ``-multicast`` and ``-multicastAddress <address>``.

The resulting command can be used as ``-multicast`` keeping its original behavior
or as ``-multicast <address>``, which will enable multicast and use <address> as
the multicast receive address.

-  Deprecated ``-nomulticast``

The default behavior is to not use multicast, so this command-line option was
redundant.

-  Updated ``-unbounded <managerMemory>`` to ``-unbounded <allocator_threshold>``

Instead of ``managerMemory``, use ``allocator_threshold``, since it better reflects
the use of the value. The new default is ``2 * dataLen`` up to ``63000``.
The associated documentation has also been improved.

-  Deprecated ``-heartbeatPeriod <sec>:<nanosec>`` and
   ``-fastHeartbeatPeriod <sec>:<nanosec>``

These parameters can still be changed via XML.

-  Deprecated ``-spin <count>``

This option made no sense after the -sleep and -pubRate alternatives were implemented.

What's Fixed in 2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Failure when Using ``-peer`` Command-Line Parameter for C#
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the ``-peer`` option in the C# implementation caused
*RTI Perftest* to fail due to an issue reserving memory. This behavior
has been fixed.

``-nic`` Command-Line Parameter not Working when Using UDPv6 Transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``-nic`` command-line parameter was not taken into account when
using the UDPv6 transport. This behavior has been fixed.


Failure when Using -batchSize or -enableTurboMode if -dataLen Exceeded Async Publishing Threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using ``-batchSize`` along with a ``-dataLen`` value greater than the asynchronous
publishing threshold caused the application to show an error and exit.
Starting with this release, the ``-batchSize`` option will be ignored in this scenario
(and a warning message displayed).

This change (ignoring ``-batchSize``) won't be applied if you explicitly set ``-asynchronous``;
in this case, the behavior will remain the same as before (it will show an error and exit).

This change also applies to the use of ``-enableTurboMode``.

Issues when Finishing Performance Test or Changing Sample Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make the mechanism to finish the performance test or change sample sizes
more robust, we now use the ``Announcement`` topic on the Subscriber side to notify
the Publisher side of the arrival of special samples sent to signal a change of sample
size or to signal that the test is finishing. In previous releases, this process was
not reliable and may have caused hangs in certain scenarios.

Unreliable Behavior Finishing Tests when Using ContentFilteredTopic (CFT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases when using CFTs, in order to finish a test, the Publisher
needed to send as many samples signaling that the test is finishing as the
number of instances that were being used by the test (1 sample per instance).
This could result in a very long process, and in scenarios where the reliability
was set to BEST_EFFORT, in a higher chance of losing one of those samples,
making the test hang.

This behavior has been modified by using a specific key for the signaling
messages, so they are not filtered by the CFTs.

Release Notes v2.2
------------------

What's New in 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added command-line parameters "-asynchronous" and "-flowController ``<``\ flow\ ``>``"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases Asynchronous Publishing was only enabled for the
DataWriters when the samples were greater than 63000 bytes and in such
case, RTI Perftest would only use a custom flow controller defined for
1Gbps networks.

This behavior has been modified: Starting with this release,
Asynchronous Publishing will be activated if the samples to send are
bigger than 63000 bytes or if the ``-asynchronous`` command-line
parameter is used. In that case, *RTI Perftest* will use the ``Default``
flow controller. However, now you can change this behavior by specifying
the ``-flowController`` option, which allows you to specify if you want
to use the default flow controller, a 1Gbps flow controller, or a 10Gbps
one.

Improved "-pubRate" command-line parameter capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the "-pubRate" command-line option would only use
the ``spin`` function to control the publication rate, which could have
negative effects related with high CPU consumption for certain
scenarios. Starting with this release, a new modifier has been added to
this option so it is possible to use the both "spin" and "sleep" as a
way to control the publication rate.

Added command-line parameter to get the CPU consumption of the process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, it is possible to display the *CPU
consumption* of the *RTI Perftest* process by adding the Command-Line
Parameter ``-cpu``.

Better support for large data samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to this release, the maximum sample size allowed by *RTI Perftest*
was set to 131072 bytes. The use of bigger sizes would imply changes in
the ``perftest.idl`` file and source code files. Starting with this
release, the maximum data length that *RTI Perftest* allows has
increased to 2,147,483,135 bytes, which corresponds to 2 Gbytes - 512
bytes - 8 bytes, the maximum data length that *RTI Connext DDS* can
send.

The sample size can be set via the ``-dataLen <bytes>`` command-line
parameter. If this value is larger than 63,000 bytes *RTI Perftest* will
enable the use of *Asynchronous Publishing* and *Unbounded Sequences*.

It is also possible to enable the use of *Unbounded Sequences* or
*Asynchronous Publishing* independently of the sample size by specifying
the command-line parameters ``unbounded <allocation_threshold>`` and
``-asynchronous``.

Added command-line parameter "-peer" to specify the discovery peers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the only way to provide the Initial Peers was
either adding them to the QoS XML file or by using the environment
variable ``NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS``. Now it is possible to use a new
command-line parameter: ``-peer <address>`` with the peer address.

Now providing RTI Routing Service configuration files to test performance along with RTI Perftest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new configuration file and wrapper script have been added for testing
RTI Perftest using one or several RTI Routing Service applications in
between Publisher and Subscriber. A new section has been added to the
documentation with all the configuration parameters: `Using RTI Perftest
with RTI Routing-Service <routing_service.md>`__.

Changed Announcement QoS profile to use "Transient local" Durability settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, the announcement topic DataWriters and DataReaders
were set to have a ``Volatile`` Durability QoS. In certain complex
scenarios, that could result in incorrect communication, which could
cause the RTI Perftest Publisher and Subscribers to get stuck and not
transmit data. By changing this topic to use Transient Local Durability,
these scenarios are avoided.

This should not have any effect on the latency of throughput reported by
RTI Perftest (as the main Throughput and Latency topics still have the
same configuration).

Added new functionality: Content Filtered Topic.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the only way to provide scalability was by using
multicast and unicast. Now you can also choose which subscriber will
receive the samples by using the parameter ``-cft``. You can also
determine which sample will be sent by the publisher with the parameter
``-writeInstance``.

What's Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conflicts when using "-multicast" and "-enableSharedMemory" at the same time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, using "-multicast" in conjunction with
"-enableSharedMemory" may have caused the middleware to fail while
trying to access multicast resources although it was set to use only
shared memory. This behavior has been fixed.

"-nic" command-line parameter not working when using TCP transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the ``-nic`` command-line parameter was not taken
into account when using the TCP transport. This behavior has been fixed.

Batching disabled when sample size was greater than or equal to batch size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the Batching Parameters were set unconditionally,
now the Batching QoS will be only applied if the Batch size is strictly
greater than the sample size.

Changed name of the "-enableTcp" option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, the command-line option to use TCP for
communication was named ``-enableTcpOnly``. This is was inconsistent
with other transport options, so the name of the command has been
changed to ``-enableTcp``.

Dynamic Data not working properly when using large samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases the following error could happen when using the
``-dynamicData`` command-line parameter in conjunction with ``-dataLen``
greater than 63000 bytes:

::

    DDS_DynamicDataStream_assert_array_or_seq_member:!sparsely stored member exceeds 65535 bytes
    DDS_DynamicData_set_octet_array:field bin_data (id=0) not found
    Failed to set uint8_t array

This error has been fixed starting in this release by resetting the
members of the Dynamic Data object before repopulating it.


Release Notes v2.1
------------------

What's New in 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multicast Periodic Heartbeats when the ``-multicast`` command-line parameter is present
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases, the Writer side sent heartbeats via unicast even
if the command-line parameter ``-multicast`` was present. Now heartbeats
will be sent via multicast when ``-multicast`` is used. This change
should not affect one-to-one scenarios, but it will reduce the number of
heartbeats the Publisher side has to send in scenarios with multiple
subscribers.

Added command-line parameter to get the *Pulled Sample Count* in the Publisher side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``-writerStats`` command-line parameter now enables the some extra
debug log messages shown in the *Publisher* side of *RTI Perftest*.
These messages will contain the total number of samples being "pulled"
by the *Subscriber* side.

Added extra logic to be able to support *RTI Connext DDS 5.2.7* on Windows Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The names of the solutions generated by *rtiddsgen* for Windows
architectures changed in Code Generator 3.2.6 (included with *RTI
Connext DDS 5.2.7*). The solution name now includes the *rtiddsgen*
version number. Therefore the *RTIPerftest*'s ``build.bat`` script now
must query the *rtiddsgen* version and adjust the name of the generated
solutions it needs to call to compile.

This change should not be noticed by the user, as the script will
automatically handle the task of determining the version of *rtiddsgen*.

Added command-line parameter to avoid loading QoS from xml in C++.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``-noXmlQos`` option is provided to *RTI Perftest* it will not
try to load the QoS from the ``xml`` file, instead it will load the QoS
from a string provided in the code. This string contains the same values
the ``xml`` file provides.

This option is only present for the Modern and Traditional C++ PSM API
code.

Note that changes in the ``xml`` will be ignored if this option is
present.

Updated Secure Certificates, Governance and Permission Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Governance and Permission files have been updated to be compatible with
the latest release for *RTI Connext DDS*, and are compatible with *RTI
Connext DDS* 5.2.7 and greater.

If you are compiling *RTI Perftest* against 5.2.5, you will need to get
the certificates from the ``release/2.0`` branch. You can do that by
using the following git command from the top-level directory of your
repository:

::

    git checkout release/2.0 -- resource/secure

What's Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"--nddshome" Command-Line Option did not Work in ``build.bat`` Script -- Windows Systems Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There was an error in the ``build.sh`` script logic when checking for
the existence of the compiler executable files. This problem has been
resolved.

``build.sh`` script did not make sure executable existed before starting compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Part of the ``build.sh`` script logic to check the existence of the
compiler executable files was not being called properly. This issue is
now fixed.

Incorrect ``high_watermark`` value when ``sendQueueSize`` is set to 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting the command-line parameter ``-sendQueueSize`` to 1 caused *RTI
Perftest* to fail, since it mistakenly set the ``high_watermark`` value
equal to the ``low_watermark``. This problem has been resolved. Now the
``high_watermark`` is always greater than the ``low_watermark``.

Batching settings not correctly set in the ``C++03`` code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Settings related to batching in the XML configuration
(``perftest_qos_profiles.xml``) were not being used. This problem has
been resolved.

``dds.transport.shmem.builtin.received_message_count_max`` incorrectly set in Java code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``dds.transport.shmem.builtin.received_message_count_max`` property
was incorrectly set to 1 in every case. This erroneous behavior, which
was introduced in *RTI Perftest 2.0*, has been resolved.

Command-line parameter for setting the *RTI Connext DDS* verbosity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous releases of RTI Perftest, the RTI Connext DDS verbosity
could only be modified by using the command-line parameter ``-debug``.
This parameter would set the verbosity to ``STATUS_ALL``, with no option
to select an intermediate verbosity.

This behavior has been modified. The command-line parameter ``-debug``
has been changed to ``-verbosity,`` which can be followed by one of the
verbosity levels (Silent, Error, Warning, or All).

The default verbosity is Error.

Release Notes v2.0
------------------

What's New in 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platform support and build system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest 2.0* makes use of the *RTI Connext DDS* *rtiddsgen* tool
in order to generate part of its code and also the makefile/project
files used to compile that code.

Therefore, all the already generated makefiles and *Visual Studio*
solutions have been removed and now the build system depends on 2
scripts: ``build.sh`` for Linux/MacOS/QNX/VxWorks/Android systems and
``build.bat`` for Windows systems.

*RTI Perftest* scripts works for every platform for which *rtiddsgen*
can generate an example, except for those in which *rtiddsgen* doesn't
generate regular makefiles or *Visual Studio Solutions* but specific
project files. That is the case of *Android* platforms as well as the
*iOS* ones.

Certain platforms will compile with the out of-the-box code and
configurations, but further tuning could be needed in order to make the
application run in the specific platform. The reason is usually the
memory consumption of the application or the lack of support of the
platform for certain features (like a file system).

Improved directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest 2.0* directory structure has been cleaned up, having now a
much more compact and consistent schema.

Github
^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* development has been moved to a *GitHub* project. This
will allow more frequently updates and code contributions.

The URL of the project is the following:
`github.com/rticommunity/rtiperftest <github.com/rticommunity/rtiperftest>`__.

Numeration schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RTI Perftest* development and releases are now decoupled from *RTI
Connext DDS* ones, therefore, and to avoid future numeration conflicts,
*RTI Perftest* moved to a different numeration schema.

The compatibility between *RTI Perftest* versions and *RTI Connext DDS*
ones will be clearly stated in the release notes of every *RTI Perftest*
release, as well as in the top-level ``README.md`` file.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Documentation is no longer provided as a PDF document, but as *markdown*
files as well as in *html* format. You will be able to access to the
documentation from the *RTI Community* page, as well as from the
*GitHub* project.

Support for UDPv6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added command-line parameter to force communication via UDPv6. By
specifying ``-enableUdpv6`` you will only communicate data by using the
UDPv6 transport.

The use of this feature will imply setting the ``NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS``
environment variable to (at least) one valid IPv6 address.

Support for Dynamic data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added command-line parameter to specify the use of the Dynamic Data API
instead of the regular *rtiddsgen* generated code use.

Simplified execution in VxWorks kernel mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The execution in *VxWorks OS kernel mode* has been simplified for the
user. Now the user can make use of ``subscriber_main()`` and
``publisher_main()`` and modify its content with all the parameters
required for the tests.

Decreased Memory Requirements for Latency Performance Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default number of iterations (samples sent by the performance test
publisher side) when performing a latency test has been updated. Before,
the default value was ``100,000,000``. This value was used to internally
allocate certain buffers, which imposed large memory requirements. The
new value is ``10,000,000`` (10 times less).

What's Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTI Perftest behavior when using multiple publishers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The previous behavior specified that an *RTI Perftest Subscriber* in a
scenario with multiple *RTI Perftest Publishers* would stop receiving
samples and exit after receiving the last sample from the *RTI Perftest*
Publisher with ``pid=0``. This behavior could lead into an hang state if
some *RTI Perftest Publishers* with different ``pid`` were still missing
to send new samples.

The new behavior makes the *RTI Perftest Subscriber* wait until all the
Perftest Publishers finish sending all their samples and then exit.

Possible ``std::bad_alloc`` and Segmentation Fault in Latency Test in case of insufficient memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When performing a latency performance test with traditional or modern
C++, the test tries to allocate certain arrays of unsigned longs. These
arrays can be quite large. On certain embedded platforms, due to memory
limitations, this caused a ``std::bad_alloc`` error that was not
properly captured, and a segmentation fault. This problem has been
resolved. Now the performance test will inform you of the memory
allocation issue and exit properly.

Default Max Number of Instances on Subscriber Side Changed to ``DDS_LENGTH_UNLIMITED``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous release, if you did not set the maximum number of
instances on the subscriber side, it would default to one instance.
Therefore the samples for all instances except the first one were lost.

The new default maximum number of instances on the subscriber side has
been changed from one to ``DDS_LENGTH_UNLIMITED``. You can change this
limit manually by setting the Parameter ``-instances <number>``.

Error when using Shared Memory and Large Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using *RTI Perftest* with large samples and enabling shared memory
we could get into the following error:

::

    Large data settings enabled (-dataLen > 63000).
    [D0001|ENABLE]NDDS_Transport_Shmem_Property_verify:received_message_count_max < 1
    [D0001|ENABLE]NDDS_Transport_Shmem_newI:Invalid transport properties.

Known Issues
------------

Compilation Errors in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Express
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to `this issue <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/code_generator/html_files/RTI_CodeGenerator_ReleaseNotes/index.htm#code_generator/ReleaseNotes/KnownIssues/Known_Issues.htm?Highlight=RTI_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION>`__
documented in the Know Issues for *RTI Connext DDS*, when compiling with
*Visual Studio 2017 Express*, you need to set the `RTI_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION`
as follows to avoid compilation errors:

::

    set RTI_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION=10.0.16299.0

[RTI Issue ID CODEGENII-800]

Shared Memory issues when running the Modern C++ API or .Net Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*RTI Perftest* uses `UDPv4` and `SHMEM` by default; however certain operating
systems don't support Shared Memory, or the default configuration is not enough for
*RTI Connext DDS* to work properly. In these cases *RTI Perftest* will show
errors when trying to create the Participant entity:

::

    [D0001|ENABLE]NDDS_Transport_Shmem_create_recvresource_rrEA:failed to initialize shared memory resource segment for key 0x40894a
    [D0001|ENABLE]NDDS_Transport_Shmem_create_recvresource_rrEA:failed to initialize shared memory resource segment for key 0x40894c
    [D0001|ENABLE]DDS_DomainParticipantPresentation_reserve_participant_index_entryports:!enable reserve participant index
    [D0001|ENABLE]DDS_DomainParticipant_reserve_participant_index_entryports:Unusable shared memory transport. For a more in-depth explanation of the possible problem and solution, please visit http://community.rti.com/kb/osx510.
    [D0001|ENABLE]DDS_DomainParticipant_enableI:Automatic participant index failed to initialize. PLEASE VERIFY CONSISTENT TRANSPORT / DISCOVERY CONFIGURATION.
    [NOTE: If the participant is running on a machine where the network interfaces can change, you should manually set wire protocol's participant id]
    DDSDomainParticipant_impl::createI:ERROR: Failed to auto-enable entity

These errors are handled and filtered in the *RTI Perftest* implementation for
the *Traditional* C++ and Java APIs, but this is still not possible for the
*Modern* C++ and .Net API.

For more information about how to configure Shared Memory, see http://community.rti.com/kb/osx510.

If you want to skip the use of Shared Memory in *RTI Perftest*, specify the transport using `-transport <kind>`, for example, `-transport UDPv4`.

Warning when compiling the *Traditional* C++ API Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*RTI Perftest* might show these warnings when compiling the *Traditional* C++
API implementation for *RTI Connext DDS Pro* (in versions prior to 6.0.0) and
for *RTI Connext DDS Micro*:

::

    In file included from perftestSupport.h:15:0,
                    from perftestSupport.cxx:11:
    perftest.h:29:25: warning: ‘THROUGHPUT_TOPIC_NAME’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
    static const DDS_Char * THROUGHPUT_TOPIC_NAME= "Throughput";
                            ^
    perftest.h:30:25: warning: ‘LATENCY_TOPIC_NAME’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
    static const DDS_Char * LATENCY_TOPIC_NAME= "Latency";
                            ^
    perftest.h:31:25: warning: ‘ANNOUNCEMENT_TOPIC_NAME’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
    static const DDS_Char * ANNOUNCEMENT_TOPIC_NAME= "Announcement";
                            ^

These warnings are the result of a known issue in *RTI Code Generator (rtiddsgen)* (CODEGENII-873) related to the way in which
the code for a const string is generated. This issue will be fixed in future releases of *RTI Connext DDS Micro* and has been
already fixed for *RTI Connext DDS Pro* 6.0.0.


Building RTI Perftest Java API against RTI Connext DDS 5.2.0.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the changes added to support larger data sizes, *RTI
Perftest* now makes use of *Unbounded Sequences*. This feature was not
added to *RTI Connext DDS* in *5.2.0.x*, so the following error will be
reported when trying to compile the Java API:

::

    [INFO]: Generating types and makefiles for java.
    [INFO]: Command: "/home/test/nevada/bin/rtiddsgen" -language java -unboundedSupport -replace -package com.rti.perftest.gen -d "/home/test/test-antonio/srcJava" "/home/test/test-antonio/srcIdl/perftest.idl"
    ERROR com.rti.ndds.nddsgen.Main Fail:  -unboundedSupport is only supported with C, C++, C++/CLI, or C# code generation
    rtiddsgen version 2.3.0
    Usage: rtiddsgen [-help]
    . . .
    INFO com.rti.ndds.nddsgen.Main Done (failures)
    [ERROR]: Failure generating code for java.

To avoid this compilation error, two changes are needed:

-  In the ``build.sh`` or ``build.bat`` scripts, modify the call for
   *rtiddsgen* and remove the ``-unboundedSupport`` flag.

-  In the ``srcIdl/perftest.idl`` file, modify the ``TestDataLarge_t``
   and ``TestDataLargeKeyed_t`` types, and add a bound to the
   ``bin_data`` member: ``sequence<octet,LIMIT> bin_data;``.

Publication rate precision on Windows systems when using "sleep" instead of "spin"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the ``-pubRate <#>:sleep`` or ``-sleep`` command-line
parameters on Windows systems, the ``sleep()`` precision will be accurate
up to 10 milliseconds. This means that for publication rates of more
than 10,000 samples per second we recommend using the "<#>:spin" option
instead.

Compiling manually on Windows systems when using the *RTI Security* plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*rtiddsgen*-generated solutions for Windows systems allow four different
configurations:

-  Debug
-  Debug DLL
-  Release
-  Release DLL

The new *RTI Perftest* build system, however, is focused on compiling
only one of those modes at a time. To choose the compilation mode,
use the ``-debug`` and ``-dynamic`` flags.

Warnings Compiling on Windows systems when using the *RTI Security* plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have found that in certain instalations of *Openssl* a missing `pdb` file
causes several warnings when compiling statically *RTI Perftest* for C++ 
(Traditional and Modern implementations). The warning that will show should be
similar to this one:

::

    libeay32z.lib(wp_block.obj) : warning LNK4099: PDB 'lib.pdb' was not found with
    'libeay32z.lib(wp_block.obj)' or at 'rtiperftest\srcCpp03\objs\i86Win32VS2015\lib.pdb';
    linking object as if no debug info [srcCpp03\perftest_publisher-i86Win32VS2015.vcxproj]

    403 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

This warning should be innocuous.

Dynamic compilation modes for *RTI Connext DDS Micro*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When building against the *RTI Connext DDS Micro* libraries, only the static
compilation modes are supported. Therefore the ``--dynamic`` option will have
no effect.

``rtiddsgen`` code generator will fail with the following message: ``Option
-sharedLib is not supported by this version of rtiddsgen``.
